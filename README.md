# Jazzee Marketplace

## Assumptions

1. **Product Similarity**: We assume that all products within a specific category are very similar or serve as direct alternatives to one another. This allows for a straightforward comparison during the auction process.

2. **Price Optimization**: The auction process optimizes directly for pricing, assuming that other requirements and features can be fulfilled by all the selected vendors.

3. **Single Bidding Event**: For simplicity, we assume that only one bidding event is sufficient, and there is no possibility for rebidding or renegotiation.

## Features

1. **Curated SaaS Product List**: The platform provides a curated list of SaaS products, categorized and easily accessible for buyers. This list is derived from the vendors' official pricing pages.


2. **Reverse Dutch Auction Simulation**: Once the products are selected, the marketplace simulates a reverse Dutch auction, where vendors submit their best price quotes based on the buyer's budget and requirements.

3. **Price Comparison**: The platform presents the best quotes received from the vendors, allowing the buyer to easily compare and make an informed purchasing decision.

4. **Simplified Purchase Process**: The best price offer is displayed to the buyer, who can then proceed with the purchase directly through the marketplace, streamlining the procurement process.
